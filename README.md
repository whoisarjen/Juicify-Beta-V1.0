This code is cringe, but here I started and now I am here -> <a href="https://github.com/whoisarjen/Juicify">Juicify v2</a> (23.02.2022)


<h2>Is it still working?</h2>


Should works, but it's just relic I want to keep, if you want to see working version, check link above.


If for some reason you want to launch it, follow Vue's documentation.


On server site you need to put mongoDB's string and make sure to use right ports for server & Redis.


<h2>Technology:</h2>


Vue, Javascript, MongoDB, Express, JWT, Redis, Socket.io, PWA, IndexedDB, Vuetify, i18n, Cookies, etc.


<h2>Live version:</h2>


Live version should be available under this <a href="https://beta.juicify.app/">link</a> until 25.06.2022.
